Abstract

  Music managers of the United Kingdom, BBC Radio hosts witness the rise, fall, and plateau of many musicians’ careers. At a recent conference, one host translated the touring history of one of the nation’s biggest bands to their career arc, putting forth a niche proposition on measuring success in music. With that idea in mind, the overall aim of this thesis is to map touring histories to British indie and alternative career arcs in a post-streaming world, ultimately creating and visualizing an artist’s career fingerprint through live music. The results identify and investigate patterns of career arcs that emerge when viewing artist touring histories at scale, informing music industry professionals what to look for in the future, informing young acts how to utilize live music, and informing fans of another exciting way to explore their favorite band. The uniqueness of the British music industry and the impact of indie and alternative music from the UK are discussed alongside why the live sector is so critical in the greater music industry at a time when albums are streamed and fandoms rally. 
  A database of British indie and alternative musicians incorporating Spotify and last.fm’s APIs was created and used to derive touring histories from Songkick’s API. Three primary data visualizations were made from the touring history dataset. First, a cluster of bubbles, with each bubble representing an individual artist. The bubble transitions into a strip / barcode plot for each artist. The lines on the strip plot are tour dates spread over an artist’s career timeline. The strip plot transitions into the third data visualization, which sees the lines translated into circles. The circles are encoded with the size of the venue at each tour date. Adding the venue size dimension allows the audience to understand the progression of success as a larger venue size translates to greater popularity at the time of the tour date. The visualizations are packaged in a visual essay and intended to exist in a data journalism space.
